# VANAPAY WALLET APP
## **Frontend Development**
##  *Introduction 🐎*

The Vanapay Wallet App is a peer-to-peer digital wallet that's automated and seamlessly incorporates APIs. It's carefully designed with a minimalistic approach and employs advanced technology to make financial transactions smooth. Its primary aim is to prioritize user needs and deliver a seamless user experience.

🔬 The current frontend interface lacks responsiveness. For the best user experience, I recommend launching it on desktop devices.

🔧 The interface has been constructed using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

🙏 I extend special thanks to my internship supervisor and senior colleagues for their invaluable tutorials and guidance, which contributed significantly to my learning and experience throughout this project.


## *Scenarios 🌌, Problems 💥 & Solutions ✨ encountered in this Project*

**Scenario 🌌 -** You implemented a Function which randomizes a string of Numbers, and hence you will utilize that function across many blocks in the codebase

**Problem 💥 -** You want to only utilize only the first result of that function across your codebase, but invoking it where needed creates a new result Value at those places required

**Solution ✨ -** Create a variable and call the Function in that variable and apply that variable wherever needed across the codebase, that way, you only get the first value called in that variable.

---

**Scenario 🌌 -** You have a collection of JS files and it contains several blocks of Functionality and Implementations.

**Problem 💥 -** You realized that these files would be interdependent to each other as the codebase grows, as you are avoiding have functionalities repeated across the entire Code Project.

**Solution ✨ -** Embrace JavaScript Modules, allowing specific functionalities like functions and variables to be exported and accessible across multiple JS files within the project. However, implementing this may pose some challenges, so it's crucial to properly source the related JS files in the HTML document that implements the JS functionalities. This step is essential to prevent any complications that may arise. For more clarity on the subject, I strongly recommend this link from Mozilla Developers Network (Cheers to them, mate 🥂) [Javascript Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)
