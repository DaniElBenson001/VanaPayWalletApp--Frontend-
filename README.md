# VanaPayWalletApp--Frontend

✌ Basically, this Project is one of my very projects I did to create a Peer-2-Peer Wallet App that I called "VANAPAY WALLET APP", designed to make seamless transactions in the Most secured way

🔬 This is the Frontend Interface, it isn't repsonsive yet so [Best advice, launch on Desktop]

🔧 Built using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript

🙏 Special Thanks to my Internship Supervisor and Senior Colleagues for the Tutorials and Experience in this Project


# Here are few Solutions I uncovered to solve menial problems in my Code

✨ IF YOU WANT TO RETURN THE EXACT VALUE ACROSS FROM A FUNCTION RANDOMIZER

When you have Function that returns Randomized Data, sending the function itself twice or more across the project will return different randomized values at the places it calls -- To solve this, place the function in a variable, and send the Variable, that way you have the same Return Response of the Function across your Project.

✨ UNDERSTANDING MODULE JAVASCRIPT WRITING SAVES TIME AND ENCOURAGES REFERENCES AND DEFINITIONS

# SPECIAL REMINDERS AND ANNOUNCEMENTS

✨ ALL MY CONSOLE IN ALL FETCH REQUESTS ARE PRIMARILY FOR TESTING, TO ENSURE THAT ALL DATA IS ACCURATELY RETRIEVED FOR CONSUMPTION; THEY
ALL WILL BE COMMENTED OUT AND DEACTIVATED UPON FINAL REFACTORING.
