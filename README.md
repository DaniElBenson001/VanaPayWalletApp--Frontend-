🙏 Special Thanks to my Internship Supervisor and Senior Colleagues for the Tutorials and Experience in this Project


# Here are few Solutions I uncovered to solve menial problems in my Code

✨ IF YOU WANT TO RETURN THE EXACT VALUE ACROSS FROM A FUNCTION RANDOMIZER

When you have Function that returns Randomized Data, sending the function itself twice or more across the project will return different randomized values at the places it calls -- To solve this, place the function in a variable, and send the Variable, that way you have the same Return Response of the Function across your Project.

✨ UNDERSTANDING MODULE JAVASCRIPT WRITING SAVES TIME AND ENCOURAGES REFERENCES AND DEFINITIONS

✨ UNABLE TO CONNEXT TO THE SERVER

This issue is very annoying to solve as there are no Error Messages or Warning Suggestions to spool. Hence to avoid this pesky error, kindly review your Code, there is probably a Service you wrongly injected into another service, hence having a service in a service will cause a "Service Dependency Conflict".

✨ UNDERSTANDING FOREIGN KEYS AND DATABASE RELATIONSHIPS SAVES A LOT WITH EF CONFLICTS

# SPECIAL REMINDERS AND ANNOUNCEMENTS

✨ ALL MY CONSOLE IN ALL FETCH REQUESTS ARE PRIMARILY FOR TESTING, TO ENSURE THAT ALL DATA IS ACCURATELY RETRIEVED FOR CONSUMPTION; THEY
ALL WILL BE COMMENTED OUT AND DEACTIVATED UPON FINAL REFACTORING.
