# VanaPayWalletApp--Frontend

✌ Basically, this Project is one of my very projects I did to create a Peer-2-Peer Wallet App that I called "VANAPAY WALLET APP", designed to make seamless transactions in the Most secured way
🔬 This is the Frontend Interface, it isn't repsonsive yet so [Best advice, launch on Desktop]
🔧 Built using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript

🙏 Special Thanks to my Internship Supervisor and Senior Colleagues for the Tutorials and Experience in this Project
